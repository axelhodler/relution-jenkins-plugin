Determines which build artifacts should be uploaded. By default only stable builds, i.e. builds
that complete with "SUCCESS" are uploaded to the store.
<p/>
If required the plugin can be reconfigured to also upload artifacts that completed with "UNSTABLE".
This setting can be overridden on each job's configuration page.
