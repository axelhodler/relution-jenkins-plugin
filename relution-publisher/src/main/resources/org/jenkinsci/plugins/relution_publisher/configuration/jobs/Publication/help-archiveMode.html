Select the archivation mode that should be used when uploading the application file. This setting
overrides the default configured on Jenkins' system configuration page in the section <i>Relution
Enterprise Appstore Publisher plugin</i>.
<br/><br/>
Archivation mode defines how to handle existing versions of an application that have the same
release status as the version being uploaded. Versions with a different release status are never
affected during upload.
<br/><br/>
By default an existing version will be replaced by the new version and the existing version is
moved to the archive. Depending on the number of builds this can result in a large number of
unused versions in the archive. To prevent this, archivation mode can be set to <i>Overwrite
current version</i>. In this mode, any existing version with the same release status as the one
being uploaded will be deleted, essentially overwriting the existing version.
