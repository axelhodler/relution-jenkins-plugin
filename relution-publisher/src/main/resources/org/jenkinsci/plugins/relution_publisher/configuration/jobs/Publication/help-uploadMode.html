Determines which build artifacts should be uploaded. By default only stable builds, i.e. builds
that complete with "SUCCESS" are uploaded to the store.
<p/>
If required the plugin can be reconfigured to also upload artifacts that completed with "UNSTABLE".
This value overrides the default configured on Jenkins' system configuration page in the section
<i>Relution Enterprise App Store Publisher plugin</i>.
