Enables additional debug output when uploading an artifact to a Relution Enterprise App Store. The
debug output contains information about the Java Virtual Machine the plugin is running in, the
security providers installed in the Java VM and the maximum key length supported for encryption.
<p/>
If the maximum supported key length for encryption is limited (i.e. the key length is not shown as
"unrestricted") uploads to servers using strong encryption may fail. You may need to install the
Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files.
